  - Stays "unknown" on a modem that has never been rebooted that way
- Hardware Status

## Buttons
Name | Description
---- | ----------
Restart | Restarts the modem

## Languages
The integration ships English and German translations and follows the language configured in Home Assistant.
Existing installations keep their entity IDs, because those are tied to each entity's internal unique ID rather than to its displayed name.

## Diagnostics
The integration supports Home Assistant's diagnostics download, reachable from the device page.
It contains the raw values of all three endpoints, with the modem's serial number redacted.

## Installation

### Preconditions
For this integration to work, the modem must be accessible from the Home Assistant host. This requires special NAT rules to be configured on the router, which is unfortunately not possible with most home routers. (Advanced routers such as OPNsense, pfSense or similar are required for this)

You can use this link to check whether your modem can be reached (if you are using the default IP address):
http://192.168.100.1/ONT/client/html/content/overview/status.html

**If the modem is not reachable, you cannot use this integration!**

### Method 1: Custom Repository (Recommended)
Click here:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Netzwerkfehler&repository=hass-GFM2&category=Integration)

**OR**

Add `https://github.com/Netzwerkfehler/hass-GFM2` as a [custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/) in HACS.

then

1. Restart Home Assistant
1. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Telekom Glasfaser-Modem 2"

### Method 2: Manual
1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
1. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
1. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `gfm2`.
1. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/gfm2/` directory (folder) in this repository.
1. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
1. Restart Home Assistant
1. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Telekom Glasfaser-Modem 2"

## Configuration is done in the UI

Only the IP address of the modem is required as a configuration parameter in this integration. It is preset to "192.168.100.1" and does not normally need to be changed.


## Internals
This integration queries these endpoints:
Method | Endpoint
------ | --------
GET    | /ONT/client/data/Status.json
GET    | /ONT/client/data/FirmwareUpdate.json
GET    | /ONT/client/data/Reboot.json
POST   | /ONT/client/data/Reboot.json
